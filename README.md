-Designed a Flappy Plane Videogame in Java that game runs on 60 FPS(Frames per second) on a 16 by 12  JFrame window.     

-Created a fun endless runner using sprites with a simple keystroke listener, the space bar, collision detction set in place, so avoid the tunnels, and collecting coins with score tracking and level updated onto the screen.
